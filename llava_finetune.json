First, describe the image on the right. What is the setting (e.g., road type, environment)? What is the weather condition? Next, describe the image on the left. What are the key differences compared to the right image, specifically regarding the time of day, weather, and visibility? Identify the key static objects present in both scenes. Static objects are things that don't move, such as the road, guardrail, fence, mountains, and streetlights. Based on the path indicated by the yellow line, is the vehicle heading towards a safe path on the road or is it heading towards one of the static objects you listed earlier (like the guardrail)? This determines if a failure is occurring. Using this information determine if there is a cause of failure in the image on the left, and explain why. If there is no cause of failure, please answer no and explain why there is no cause of failure.
