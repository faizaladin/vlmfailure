First, think about the setting and weather conditions in the image on the right. Next, think about the setting and weather conditions in the image on the left. Think about the differences between the image on the left and the image on the right, specifically regarding the time of day, weather, and visibility. Look at the key static objects present in both scenes. Static objects are things that don't move, such as the road, guardrail, fence, mountains, and streetlights. Based on the path indicated by the yellow line, think if the vehicle is heading towards a safe path on the road or if it is heading towards one of the static objects you listed earlier (like the guardrail).

First, think about the setting and weather conditions in the image on the right. Next, think about the setting and weather conditions in the image on the left. Think about the differences between the image on the left and the image on the right, specifically regarding the time of day, weather, and visibility. Look at the key static objects present in both scenes. Static objects are things that don't move, such as the road, guardrail, fence, mountains, and streetlights. Based on the path indicated by the yellow line, think if the vehicle is heading towards a safe path on the road or if it is heading towards one of the static objects you listed earlier (like the guardrail).

First, think about the setting and weather conditions in the image on the right. Next, think about the setting and weather conditions in the image on the left. Think about the differences between the image on the left and the image on the right, specifically regarding the time of day, weather, and visibility. Look at the key static objects present in both scenes. Static objects are things that don't move, such as the road, guardrail, fence, mountains, and streetlights. Based on the path indicated by the yellow line, think if the vehicle is heading towards a safe path on the road or if it is heading towards one of the static objects you listed earlier (like the guardrail).

First, think about the setting and weather conditions in the image on the right. Next, think about the setting and weather conditions in the image on the left. Think about the differences between the image on the left and the image on the right, specifically regarding the time of day, weather, and visibility. Look at the key static objects present in both scenes. Static objects are things that don't move, such as the road, guardrail, fence, mountains, and streetlights. Based on the path indicated by the yellow line, think if the vehicle is heading towards a safe path on the road or if it is heading towards one of the static objects you listed earlier (like the guardrail).

First, think about the setting and weather conditions in the image on the right. Next, think about the setting and weather conditions in the image on the left. Think about the differences between the image on the left and the image on the right, specifically regarding the time of day, weather, and visibility. Look at the key static objects present in both scenes. Static objects are things that don't move, such as the road, guardrail, fence, mountains, and streetlights. Based on the path indicated by the yellow line, think if the vehicle is heading towards a safe path on the road or if it is heading towards one of the static objects you listed earlier (like the guardrail).

First, think about the setting and weather conditions in the image on the right. Next, think about the setting and weather conditions in the image on the left. Think about the differences between the image on the left and the image on the right, specifically regarding the time of day, weather, and visibility. Look at the key static objects present in both scenes. Static objects are things that don't move, such as the road, guardrail, fence, mountains, and streetlights. Based on the path indicated by the yellow line, think if the vehicle is heading towards a safe path on the road or if it is heading towards one of the static objects you listed earlier (like the guardrail).

First, think about the setting and weather conditions in the image on the right. Next, think about the setting and weather conditions in the image on the left. Think about the differences between the image on the left and the image on the right, specifically regarding the time of day, weather, and visibility. Look at the key static objects present in both scenes. Static objects are things that don't move, such as the road, guardrail, fence, mountains, and streetlights. Based on the path indicated by the yellow line, think if the vehicle is heading towards a safe path on the road or if it is heading towards one of the static objects you listed earlier (like the guardrail).

First, think about the setting and weather conditions in the image on the right. Next, think about the setting and weather conditions in the image on the left. Think about the differences between the image on the left and the image on the right, specifically regarding the time of day, weather, and visibility. Look at the key static objects present in both scenes. Static objects are things that don't move, such as the road, guardrail, fence, mountains, and streetlights. Based on the path indicated by the yellow line, think if the vehicle is heading towards a safe path on the road or if it is heading towards one of the static objects you listed earlier (like the guardrail).

    "prompt": "This is a paired image of two cars using a vision based algorithm to steer under different weather conditions, while following the yellow line on the road. First, think about the setting and weather conditions in the image on the right. Next, think about the setting and weather conditions in the image on the left. Think about the differences between the image on the left and the image on the right, specifically regarding the time of day, weather, and visibility. Look at the key static objects present in both scenes. Static objects are things that don't move, such as the road, guardrail, fence, mountains, and streetlights. Based on the path indicated by the yellow line, think if the vehicle is heading towards a safe path on the road or if it is heading towards one of the static objects you listed earlier (like the guardrail). This determines if a failure is occurring. Using this information, is there a cause of failure in the image on the left?. Answer in yes or no format.",
