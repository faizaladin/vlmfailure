# VLM Safety Analysis

The purpose of this repository is to finetune LlaVa 1.5 on trajectories of cars under various weather conditions and determine whether the car will successfully stay on the road or fail by committing a lane violation or crashing. Additionally we use a fully automated approach by assigning labels while collecting data to avoid human labeled data. This way the VLM uses an end-to-end training approach.
